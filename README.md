Create plots for more than 1 sample.

Objective:
In a dataset which has more samples than you can imagine, plot the mutationals signature calls.
This code rearranges the mutational signature calls of samples in an ascending order. 

There are 30 mutational signature calls in the COSMIC database. Please refer to 
(https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2)
for meaningful interpretation of the mutational signatures. 

As an example in the data/output file please check this pdf generated 

<img src=data/output/test_mutational_signature.png>

With more number of samples(snapshot) this is what it looks like.The signatures less than 20 have been removed.
